APT-MARK-SYNC
=============

Currently apt, aptitude, debfoster and deborphan each keep their own status
database of which packages have been installed manually (i.e. the user requested
their installation) and which have been installed automatically (i.e. they were
installed as dependencies of manually installed packages).

apt-mark-sync reads the status for each package from one of the databases and
writes it to the others. For instance, if you set a package as manually
installed in debfoster and run ‘apt-mark-sync debfoster apt aptitude’, both apt
and aptitude consider it to be manually installed.

Note that it’s not recommended to use apt as a sync source, since it’s much
easier to manage the packages’ auto-installed status with debfoster, deborphan
or aptitude.

See apt-mark-sync(1) for more information.
