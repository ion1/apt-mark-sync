NAME
----
apt-mark-sync - synchronize the 'automatically installed' field between package
managers


SYNOPSIS
--------
*apt-mark-sync* 'READER' [all | 'WRITER' ...]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Currently *apt*, *aptitude*, *debfoster* and *deborphan* each keep their own
status database of which packages have been installed manually (i.e. the user
requested their installation) and which have been installed automatically (i.e.
they were installed as dependencies of manually installed packages).

apt-mark-sync reads the status for each package from one of the databases and
writes it to the others. For instance, if you set a package as manually
installed in debfoster and run *apt-mark-sync debfoster apt aptitude*, both apt
and aptitude consider it to be manually installed.

Note that it's not recommended to use apt as a sync source, since it's much
easier to manage the packages' auto-installed status with debfoster, deborphan
or aptitude.


EXAMPLES
--------
*$$aptitude install debfoster; apt-mark-sync aptitude all$$*::
  Synchronizes from aptitude to apt, debfoster and deborphan.

*$$debfoster; apt-mark-sync debfoster all$$*::
  Synchronizes from debfoster to apt, aptitude and deborphan.
